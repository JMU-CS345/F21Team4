Our dog app makes it easy to do various activities involving dogs. 
One feature finds random images of dogs or an image of a specific dog breed, 
another provides fleshed out image editing capability with import and 
export features, another is a dog fact generator, and a list of dog games 
for the user to open in their browser. 
The application uses an open source 
API that is formatted to be a JSON file.
